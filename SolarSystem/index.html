        <h3>SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>The solar system is a vast and fascinating collection of celestial bodies bound together by gravity, with the Sun at its center. It includes eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other objects. The Sun, a star located about 93 million miles from Earth, provides the necessary light and heat to sustain life on our planet. 

            The eight planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet is unique in size, composition, and atmosphere, with Earth being the only one known to support life. 
            
            In addition to the planets, the solar system also features a variety of smaller objects. Asteroids are rocky bodies found mostly in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Comets, made of ice and dust, travel through the solar system in elongated orbits. Dwarf planets, like Pluto, are smaller than the major planets but still orbit the Sun.
            
            The solar system extends far beyond the orbit of Neptune, where the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud contain many icy bodies and comets. These regions mark the outermost reaches of the Sun's gravitational influence. Together, the solar system forms an intricate and dynamic system that has fascinated astronomers and scientists for centuries.</p>
